This application detects potential fraudulent behavior based on typing patterns using a local Mistral language model. 

It captures keystroke data such as key press durations and latencies through embedded JavaScript, then analyzes the typing behavior to identify anomalies like unusually fast typing, high latency, or repetitive input. 

The analyzed data is then passed to a LLM via LangChainâ€™s CTransformers interface for further evaluation. 

The app displays whether the typing behavior appears legitimate or fraudulent, providing explanations for its assessment.

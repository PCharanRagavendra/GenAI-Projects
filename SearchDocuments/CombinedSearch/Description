A multi-source AI agent that answers order-related questions by combining data from a SQLite database, Wikipedia, and local PDF documents.

Built using LangChain and OpenAI’s GPT-3.5, it integrates multiple tools (SQL query execution, Wikipedia search, and document retrieval via FAISS embeddings) into a single conversational interface.

Key Features:

Uses SQLDatabaseChain to query an orders1.db SQLite database.

Retrieves external information from Wikipedia using WikipediaQueryRun.

Processes local PDFs into searchable chunks using FAISS vector search.

Employs LangChain’s multi-tool agent architecture for intelligent query routing.

Streamlit UI for seamless question–answer interaction.

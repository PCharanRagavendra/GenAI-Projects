A dual-mode AI assistant capable of answering questions from both CSV and PDF files.
It automatically detects the uploaded file type and uses the appropriate LangChain pipeline â€” a CSV agent for tabular data or a RetrievalQA chain for text-based PDFs.

Key Features:

Upload interface for CSV and PDF files using Streamlit sidebar.

CSV Mode: Uses create_csv_agent with OpenAI LLM to analyze structured data.

PDF Mode: Converts PDFs into embeddings with SentenceTransformerEmbeddings and retrieves answers via Gemini-Pro (Google Generative AI).

Built-in file management system to delete uploaded files.

Unified question interface for multi-format document understanding.
